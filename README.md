This is a little program that serves as bowling calculator that I quickly put up together in a few days.

This is a program I made for a party. Because we are in quarantine we are bowling inside an apartment and I didn't like some of the calculators online. I did decide to make this program last minute so it is extremely rushed, but I feel like it proves that I can code quickly to get to a solution. I probably won't bother to make it DRY etc because I have no purpose to anymore, but thought it was worth talking about.

The hardest challenges was hard coding an algorithm to deal with Strikes, Spares, Doubles, Turkeys, and any combination of those options back to back. Realistically it wasn't too difficult to code but learning the rules was the "harder" part.

Thanks!

P.S.
The party was a success!
